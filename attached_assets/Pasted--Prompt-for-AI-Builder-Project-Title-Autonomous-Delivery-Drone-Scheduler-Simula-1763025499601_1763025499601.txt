### 🚀 **Prompt for AI Builder**

**Project Title:** Autonomous Delivery Drone Scheduler (Simulation-Based)

**Goal:**
Build a **simulation** (no real drone hardware control) that models and visualizes how multiple autonomous delivery drones are scheduled and coordinated efficiently using **operating system scheduling principles** such as **priority scheduling, preemption, and synchronization**.

---

### 🧩 **Project Overview**

The system should simulate a fleet of drones performing delivery tasks (pickup → delivery → charging) under the control of a **central scheduler**.
Each **drone is modeled as a thread**, and **tasks are stored in a priority queue**.
Synchronization mechanisms (like mutex locks or semaphores) will be used to ensure that shared resources (like **charging stations** and **loading bays**) are accessed safely.

The aim is to **visualize and analyze how scheduling algorithms handle concurrent operations** in a real-world–inspired logistics scenario.

### 🧠 **Core Components**

1. **Drone Threads**

   * Each drone runs as a separate thread.
   * Attributes:

     * Drone ID
     * Speed (affects delivery time)
     * Battery level
     * Task queue (deliveries assigned)
   * Behavior:

     * Executes delivery tasks.
     * Requests charging when battery is low.
     * Waits if no task is available.

2. **Delivery Task Queue**

   * Implemented as a **priority queue** (higher priority = urgent delivery).
   * Each task contains:

     * Task ID
     * Source location
     * Destination location
     * Priority (1 = highest)
     * Estimated delivery time

3. **Central Scheduler**

   * Continuously monitors the task queue and drone statuses.
   * Assigns tasks to drones based on:

     * Drone availability
     * Task priority
     * Drone battery level
   * Handles **preemption** (urgent task interrupts current low-priority delivery).
   * Reassigns tasks if a drone becomes unavailable (low battery or charging).

4. **Synchronization (Concurrency Control)**

   * **Mutex locks / semaphores** ensure drones don’t simultaneously use shared resources.
   * Shared resources:

     * Charging stations (limited count)
     * Loading bays
   * Proper logging or visualization when resources are locked/unlocked.

### ⚙️ **Simulation Features**

1. **Visualization (Optional but Encouraged):**

   * GUI or console-based simulation showing:

     * Drone movements (simulated progress bars or animated icons)
     * Task assignment logs
     * Queue status (priority-based ordering)
     * Charging activity

2. **Scheduling Algorithms to Demonstrate:**

   * Priority Scheduling (main algorithm)
   * Round Robin or FCFS (optional comparison)
   * Preemptive scheduling (urgent deliveries interrupt ongoing ones)

3. **Concurrency Demonstration:**

   * Show multiple drones performing deliveries concurrently.
   * Log statements like:

     * `[Drone 1] Picked up task T3 (priority 2)`
     * `[Drone 2] Waiting for charging station`
     * `[Scheduler] Preempted Drone 3 for urgent task T1`

---

### 🧰 **Implementation Details**

* **Language:** C or C++
* **Libraries:** pthreads, semaphores (`pthread.h`, `semaphore.h`)
* **Core Concepts Used:**

  * Threads
  * Mutex locks
  * Semaphores
  * Priority queues
  * Preemption handling
  * Logging/visualization

---

### 📊 **Expected Output / Results**

* Console or GUI display of:

  * Task queue before and after scheduling
  * Drone status updates in real-time
  * Resource lock/unlock messages
  * Task completion summary

* Educational insights:

  * How scheduling affects delivery efficiency.
  * How preemption alters task flow.
  * Impact of synchronization on system stability.

---

### 🌟 **Bonus Enhancements (Optional if possible if time permits)**

* Include **battery consumption simulation** (battery drains during tasks).
* Add a **charging time delay**.
* Use **color-coded visualization** for different priorities.
* Add statistics at the end:

  * Average delivery time
  * Total preemptions
  * Resource utilization percentage

---

### 🧩 **Example Simulation Flow**

1. Initialize 3 drones (D1, D2, D3).
2. Add 6 delivery tasks with mixed priorities.
3. Scheduler assigns tasks based on priority.
4. Drones execute deliveries concurrently.
5. One drone encounters low battery → requests charging.
6. Scheduler pauses its task, reallocates pending deliveries.
7. New urgent task arrives → preempts one active drone.
8. Simulation logs all events for analysis.

---

### 🧑‍💻 **Deliverables**

* Source code implementing the simulator.
* Visualization (either console-based or GUI-based).
* Log or report summarizing:

  * Task allocations
  * Scheduling decisions
  * Synchronization events
* Brief readme explaining usage and algorithms implemented.
